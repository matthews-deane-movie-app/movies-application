//TODO: When page loads
Display a "loading..." message

------Make an AJAX request to get a listing of all the movies

//TODO:Add a movie
Create a form for adding a new movie that has fields for the movie's title and rating

When the form is submitted, the page should not reload/refresh, instead, your javascript should make a POST request to /movies with the information the user put into the form

//TODO: Edit a movie
Give users the option to edit an existing movie

The form in which the movie will be edited should
pre-populate with the selected movie's information

Like creating a movie, this should not involve any page reloads, instead, your javascript code should make a fetch request when the form is submitted.

//TODO: Delete movies

Each movie should have a "delete" button
When this button is clicked, your javascript should send a DELETE request

//TODO:
Show a loading animation instead of just text that says "loading...".
ext that says "loading...".
