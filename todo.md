//TODO: When page loads
Display a "loading..." message

Make an AJAX request to get a listing of all the movies

//TODO:Add a movie
Create a form for adding a new movie that has fields for the movie's title and rating

When the form is submitted, the page should not reload/refresh, instead, your javascript should make a POST request to /movies with the information the user put into the form

//TODO: Edit a movie
Give users the option to edit an existing movie

The form in which the movie will be edited should
pre-populate with the selected movie's information

Like creating a movie, this should not involve any page reloads, instead, your javascript code should make a fetch request when the form is submitted.

//TODO: Delete movies

Each movie should have a "delete" button
When this button is clicked, your javascript should send a DELETE request

//TODO:
Show a loading animation instead of just text that says "loading...".
ext that says "loading...".

Use modals for creating and editing movie forms.

Add a genre property to every movie.

Allow users to sort the movies by rating, title, or genre (if you have it).

Allow users to search through the movies by rating, title, or genre (if you have it).

Use a free movie API like OMDB to include extra info or render movie posters.
